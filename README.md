# KronoEngine
C++ OpenGL Renderer

*** CODE INCOMPLETED RIGHT NOW ***

This is an adaptation of the renderer i developed in my last college year.

A lot of code could be improved, for the moment remains almost as in May 2015. The only important change is replace SFML, now it uses GLFW for the OpenGL context.
